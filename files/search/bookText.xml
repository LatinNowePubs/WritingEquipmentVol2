              1. Introduction to writing equipment








                 riting equipment is key for the comprehensive study of
           WRoman handwriting, non-monumental inscriptions and
           literacy. Cost, material and design of the equipment and how
           it was used had an impact on many aspects of writing such
           as letter shapes, document layout and who was writing. Im-
           portantly, the equipment also has an impact on what kinds of
           ancient handwritten texts have survived and therefore on our
           understanding of writing in antiquity. However, for a long time,
           research paid little attention to Roman writing equipment. One
           reason for this neglect is that finds of writing implements are
           often difficult to recognise and can end up labelled incorrectly
           or undetected with other small finds. Styli have been mistaken
           for hairpins, spindles or nails, spatulas and penknives have been
           categorised as razor knives, inkwells as pyxides and seal boxes
           as anything from jewellery to salt and pepper shakers (see e.g.

           instruments such as spatulas and tools with a metal point are far
           from monofunctional and can often only be identified as writing
           implements through context and associated finds.

                 ho wrote in the Roman world? The current discussion
           Wsurrounding this question still largely happens in reaction
           to Harris’ seminal book on ancient literacy from 1989. His estimate
           that a maximum of 10% of the population was able to read and write,
           even in the most ‘Romanized’ areas, was largely based on lapidary
           epigraphic and literary evidence and on the lack of infrastructure
           such as an institutionalised school system. Considering the wealth
           of non-lapidary and archaeological evidence for writing, many
           scholars now think that while Harris’ observations about high levels
           of illiteracy remain relevant, his vision downplays the widespread
           nature of literacy in the Roman world. The more recent scholarly
           discussion has moved away from trying to quantify literacy and
           on to exploring different kinds and standards of literacy and their
           place within society (e.g. Woolf 2015).
           The great variety of texts that survive from Roman antiquity
           reflects the different kinds of writing that happened in different
           environments and for different purposes – much as is the case
           today: it ranges from composing literature to copying or writing
           down dictated texts such as letters, writing for record-keeping,
           reporting and accountancy, for labelling goods, for everyday use
           such as shopping lists or jokes (see Volume 1). Researchers agree
           that writing touched almost all aspects of life in the Roman empire
           in one way or another. Even for the illiterate this will often have               Fig. 4: Professional scribae: so-called ‘ara degli scribi’ from Rome

           Different kinds of writing are often associated with different social
           status. The kind of writing most readers of this manual will have
           encountered first and most extensively are literary texts and thus
           writing in the sense of composing. This kind of writing represents
           only a small portion of writing in the Roman period and, in most
           cases, it happened in a specific, well-educated and high-status
           environment. Children of the upper social strata, boys and girls
           alike, were commonly educated to read and write with proficiency
           but for the majority of the population the availability of such
           education varied greatly across the empire and was dependent on
           opportunity and financial means.

           Writing documents involved a second person who was writing down
           what was dictated, often a slave or a freedman. Scribae in public
           administration and teachers were often of similar social status.
           The apparent contradiction of low status and a skill considered
           to be empowering has drawn much attention to the role of the
           scribae, the great potential for upward social mobility it entailed
           and the influential individuals it created (see e.g. Hartmann 2020).
           Similarly, in the military, literacy offered a clear advantage with
           regard to career prospects (e.g. Haynes 2013, 323–328).

           Wcomes to mind is what we write with and what we write on,                     Roman styli were mainly used to write on wax tablets but also for
           e.g. pen and paper. But if we think further there are a number of              other surfaces such as lead and wood. They were mostly made of
           accessories needed, or useful, for writing, for example to help keep           metal, with iron and copper-alloys being the most commonly used
           equal distance between lines (ordination), to carry writing sets in            materials. Early Roman styli are made of bone and they are not
           or to prepare ink with.                                                        usually found after the 1st century CE (Schaltenbrand Obrecht 2012,

           will be introduced in some detail. These include styli, pens and               Egypt and must have existed in other places as well (Schaltenbrand

           Roman excavation sites are also described. The catalogue ends with
           tools for which the evidence is scarce or ambiguous. These include
           stones used to sharpen styli, pieces of lead used to draw lines to
           write on, stones and sponges used as erasers, small objects used to
           separate the ‘pages’ of bundles of writing tablets, etc. In addition
           to these, and not discussed in the catalogue, there are many other
           tools which can be associated with writing in some contexts but
           that are not specifically writing equipment. These include utensils
           that may have been used to mix ink and paint or to prepare wax,
           such as stirrers, spoons and spoon-probes, certain spatulas, stone
           palettes and small vessels.

 hen thinking of writing implements, the first thing that   Stylus (stilus/graphium)
 Wcomes to mind is what we write with and what we write on,   Roman styli were mainly used to write on wax tablets but also for
 e.g. pen and paper. But if we think further there are a number of  other surfaces such as lead and wood. They were mostly made of
 accessories needed, or useful, for writing, for example to help keep  metal, with iron and copper-alloys being the most commonly used
 equal distance between lines (ordination), to carry writing sets in  materials. Early Roman styli are made of bone and they are not

 Roman excavation sites are also described. The catalogue ends with
 tools for which the evidence is scarce or ambiguous. These include
 stones used to sharpen styli, pieces of lead used to draw lines to
 write on, stones and sponges used as erasers, small objects used to
 separate the ‘pages’ of bundles of writing tablets, etc. In addition
 to these, and not discussed in the catalogue, there are many other
 tools which can be associated with writing in some contexts but
 that are not specifically writing equipment. These include utensils
 that may have been used to mix ink and paint or to prepare wax,
 such as stirrers, spoons and spoon-probes, certain spatulas, stone
 palettes and small vessels.

           Brushholders or brushes are mainly identified through the context
           in which they were found. For example two brushes were found
           in the so-called painter’s grave in St-Médard-des-Prés (France)
           with various vessels containing what was interpreted as paint,                          5.2 Main materials for writing on

           been attached to the metal shaft with a copper wire (Fünfschilling

           The use of the brush is not mentioned in the context of writing in Latin

 Brushholders or brushes are mainly identified through the context
 in which they were found. For example two brushes were found
 in the so-called painter’s grave in St-Médard-des-Prés (France)
 with various vessels containing what was interpreted as paint,   5.2 Main materials for writing on
 tools and other objects thought to have belonged to a painter when   and document types
 excavated in the 19th century. In this case, the bristles seem to have
 been attached to the metal shaft with a copper wire (Fünfschilling
 2012, 180).  Ink tablet/leaf tablet (tilia)
           Roman ink tablets were made of wood using various techniques.
           The best-known kind are wooden leaf tablets made of thin shavings

           thick and roughly comparable in size to a modern postcard, but
 Fünfschilling 2012, 180–181; Humphreys 2021, 208-10; Raux and Widehen 2015
           some are quite a bit larger and can, for example, measure 25 cm in
           length. Texts are sometimes written across, sometimes along, the
           grain. They were often folded down the centre to form a diptych.
 Selected ancient literary evidence:
 The use of the brush is not mentioned in the context of writing in Latin
 literature. Pliny the Elder (NH 9.148) mentions sponges used as brushes
 and (NH 28.235) a remedy for burns made from the bristles of plasterers’
 brushes; Cicero (Q. fr. 2.13.2) uses painting with a brush as a metaphor for
 literary description.

           Roman wax tablets are usually up to 5 mm thick and the dimensions
           vary. Generally they are a good size to fit into a hand, around
           10–15 x 15–20 cm. Many are smaller and some seem to have been
           considerably larger, up to around 30 cm in length (Božič and Feugère
           2004, 22). Some were inscribed horizontally, others vertically.
           Usually, several tablets, often two or three, would be tied together
           to form diptychs/polyptychs or codices, also referred to as pugillaria
           in ancient sources. They could then be flipped like book pages.
           When the wax needed replacing, it was scraped out with a spatula
           which was also used to spread the new wax (Gaitzsch 1984). Rare
           examples made of ivory or bone have also been found (Božič and
           Feugère 2004, 25).
           Remains of wax are sometimes preserved (see e.g. Speidel 1996,
           90–91).  It  was  usually  blackened  with  carbon,  sometimes  red
           (Marichal 1992b, 171). In most cases however the wax filling is
           lost. What remains are traces of writing where the stylus had gone

           Papyrus was written on with ink and widely used in the Mediterranean
           from at least around 3000 BCE and throughout the Roman and late
           antique periods. It was made from the stalk of the papyrus plant
           (Cyperus papyrus), a perennial wetland sedge that was cultivated in
           Egypt in shallow stagnant water.
           The production of papyrus is described by Pliny (NH 13.74–82)
           but his account is unclear in detail (Bülow-Jacobsen 2009, 5–9).
           Generally, the stalk was peeled and cut into strips which were soaked
           and joined to form a sheet. Different parts of the stalk resulted in
           different qualities of papyrus. Another layer was put on top with
           the fibres running perpendicular to the first one. The sheets were                   Fig. 33: Augustan era papyrus from Oxyrhynchos (Egypt),

           called umbilicus or scapus. Volumina were often labelled with small
           parchment or wooden labels for easier retrieval from storage and
           were transported in designated buckets. Less commonly sheets of

           Lead and other metal tablets

           Thin sheets of soft metal were inscribed with styli and used for
           a variety of texts, mostly of a non-official nature, when a more
           durable support was needed. The sheets could easily be cut to any
           desired size and shape, folded or rolled for transport, storage or
           deposition and pierced for display or attaching.

           Lead is the metal most commonly used for handwriting (Božič and
           Feugère 2004, 25–29). Most notably it was used for curse tablets
           (defixiones), not only in Roman times but already in classical Greece.
           Such tablets were used, for example, to demand justice following
           a theft or to curse professional opponents or rivals in love. Curse
           tablets are usually rectangular or square and of varying size, with
           lengths mostly around 10 cm but ranging anywhere from 3–4 cm
           up to nearly 30 cm. The texts often invoke deities of the underworld
           and can contain spells and magical phrases now incomprehensible.

           Accessories for finishing and editing: sponge
           (spongea) and pumice (pumex)

           Roman authors mention sponges for erasing texts written with ink.
           Martial jokingly sends his work to a patron along with a sponge so
           that it can be rendered inoffensive (Mart. 4.10.5–8), and according
           to Suetonius, Augustus used to tell friends that the ‘Ajax’ that he
           had been trying to write had succumbed to the sponge (Suet. Aug.

           15), but the rounded object next to other writing equipment could
           also be a pumice.

           A hemispherical pumice stone with marks of use was found in the

           Spatula

           Wax spatulas were used to scrape wax out of used writing tablets
           (tabulae ceratae) but also to spread and flatten wax, to which end
           they were probably heated. They are usually made of a roughly
           triangular iron blade and an iron or copper-alloy handle. Their
           dimensions can vary substantially within the range of 14–24 cm
           in length and 3–10 cm in width (Gaitzsch 1984).                                 Fig. 51: Typology of spatulae by Feugère 1995, 322. © Michel Feugère.

           Sharpener for styli

           Similar to the nib of a pen, the tip of a stylus would wear down
           quickly depending on the material, the surface and how frequently
           it was used. A small block of sandstone found together with three
           Augustan bone styli in Basel (Switzerland) has been interpreted
           as a sharpener (Fellmann 1955, 124). One of its edges features
           indentations which seem to be marks from whetting. Metal styli too
           could be sharpened with whetstones. Finds of very similar styli but
           of different length may be the result of previous continuous use and
           sharpening of the shorter examples (Schaltenbrand Obrecht 2012,
           78–79). A small whetstone from Lincolnshire (United Kingdom)
           with a groove on one side was interpreted by R. S. O. Tomlin as a

 Sharpener for styli

 Similar to the nib of a pen, the tip of a stylus would wear down
 quickly depending on the material, the surface and how frequently
 it was used. A small block of sandstone found together with three
 Augustan bone styli in Basel (Switzerland) has been interpreted
 as a sharpener (Fellmann 1955, 124). One of its edges features
 indentations which seem to be marks from whetting. Metal styli too
 could be sharpened with whetstones. Finds of very similar styli but
 of different length may be the result of previous continuous use and
 sharpening of the shorter examples (Schaltenbrand Obrecht 2012,
 78–79). A small whetstone from Lincolnshire (United Kingdom)
 with a groove on one side was interpreted by R. S. O. Tomlin as a

           Book box/bucket (capsa/scrinium/cista)

           Volumina of papyrus were transported in usually cylindrical and
           sometimes rectangular boxes. They are well known from iconographic
           evidence and are depicted for example on funerary reliefs, as part
           of statues and in mosaics (Feugère 2006, 233–237). Such buckets
           were made of wood and generally do not survive, but metal lock-
           plates with a characteristic design and shape have been preserved
           and identified (Pugsley 2003, 95–99; Feugère 2006; Eckardt 2021).
           Examples are known from across the northwestern provinces and
           from Pompeii.

           also of bone (Božič and Feugère 2004, 24). They were added to the
           tablets of codices to protect the inscribed surfaces by keeping them
           apart. They were positioned in the centre of the tablet(s) or along                    Fig. 71: Label still in place on a 2nd-century papyrus,

           Archaeological evidence for separators is rare and it is assumed that
           they were in most cases detachable and consequently lost but one
           of the wax tablets excavated at the Bloomberg site in London has a
           small rectangular separator in the centre which was fashioned from
           the original surface and not separately (Tomlin 2016, 252–255).
           Archaeological evidence for separators is known for both wax
           tablets and ink tablets. Other examples for wax tablets were found
           at Vindonissa (Switzerland), where the wooden separator measures
           5.5 x 7 mm (Speidel 1996, 90–93 and 24); or in Herculaneum
           (Italy), in this case a codex with eight pages (Marichal 1992b, 173
           and fig. 2). An example for the use of separators with ink tablets
           is a wooden book with three orations by Isocrates found in Kellis
           (Dakhleh-Oasis, Egypt) and dating to the 4th century CE. In this
           case, three separators made of leather were added after the tablets
           were inscribed and distributed along the longer edges of each tablet
           (Sharpe III 1992, e.g. fig. 14–21; Whitehorne 1996).
